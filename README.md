# ctci_rust: Cracking the Coding Interview in Rust

For refreshing coding skills and bumping up Rust knowledge I'm solving some of the coding Questions from the book "Cracking the Coding Interview".

Admittedly, I'm getting some help from the totally amazing Warp Terminal. I asked it to either write some additional tests or to improve the coding style to make it look more "rusty".

For some questions I also asked Warp to solve the riddle. It naturally has no problems... It also recognizes that it is a riddle from the book. It might be interesting to challenge Warp with an unknow riddle.

I also used Warp to add, commit, and push code changes to github. It does create pretty well-written commit messages.

So all in all - I never thought that these coding riddles make sense to find out if a job candidate is good. But with AI-support they really are obsolete.
